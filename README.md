The team will create a playable version to test elements and find any bugs. The alpha stage is used to complete the core functionality of the game. In the beta stage the team will focus on completing the map for the game this includes all levels, themes, and all elements placed in the map.  This test will require unit testing, to fix all bugs found in the alpha stage. The team will also have multiple game tests for any additional feedback.
